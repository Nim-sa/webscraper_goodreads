# Goodreads Book Scraper (100 Pages)

This is a Python-based web scraper that extracts book data from Goodreads' public list:  
[Best Books Ever](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/1.Best_Books_Ever).

The scraper collects data from the first 100 pages of the list, extracting each book's title, author, and average rating.  
All results are saved to a structured CSV file for further analysis.

---

## Features

- Scrapes book data across 100 pages
- Extracts title, author, and rating information
- Handles polite request delays to prevent blocking
- Saves output to a CSV file
- Optional: cleans numeric ratings for analysis

---

## Output

**File:** `goodreads_best_books_100_pages.csv`  
**Columns:**
- `Title`
- `Author`
- `Rating Info` (e.g., "4.36 avg rating — 1,543,211 ratings")
- `Rating` *(optional cleaned float)*

---

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the Jupyter Notebook
2. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
````

3. Run the `goodreads_scraper.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter

---

## Example Usage

```python
# View top authors by number of books
df["Author"].value_counts().head(10)

# Filter books with high average ratings
df[df["Rating"] >= 4.5]
```

---

## Notes

* Each page takes approximately 5–10 seconds to fetch and parse
* A delay (`time.sleep(2)`) is included between requests to avoid IP blocking
* For educational and portfolio purposes only
